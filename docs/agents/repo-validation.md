# Repo Validation

## Runtime Baseline

- Node: `>=24 <25`
- Package manager: `npm`
- Source: TypeScript
- Stable launcher: `bin/tiangong-ai.js`
- Repository text checkout uses LF line endings through `.gitattributes`; this
  keeps Prettier behavior consistent across Linux and Windows CI runners.

## Local Gates

Run before delivery:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run test:coverage
docpact validate-config --root . --strict
docpact lint --root . --worktree --mode enforce
```

`npm run prepush:gate` aggregates the lint, coverage, and docpact checks when
`docpact` is installed locally.

## Release Flow

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` publishes `@tiangong-ai/cli` to npm from
GitHub Actions. It runs the same npm lint, test, and coverage gates before any
publish attempt.

Publishing starts when a `v*` tag is pushed. The tag must match
`package.json` version exactly, for example `v0.1.0` for version `0.1.0`.

The workflow uses npm Trusted Publishing through GitHub OIDC. Configure npm
trusted publisher metadata for this repository and workflow before first use;
do not configure an npm token secret. The publish job keeps `id-token: write`
enabled, upgrades npm for trusted publishing, checks that the version is not
already published, runs the local gates, performs a package dry run, and then
executes `npm publish --access public --provenance`.

## Coverage Policy

The coverage gate uses `c8` and fails when coverage drops below the thresholds
encoded in `scripts/run-test-coverage.cjs`. Coverage ignore pragmas are
forbidden; cover the branch or remove dead code.

The initial v0 threshold is intentionally conservative. Raise it as command
coverage grows.
